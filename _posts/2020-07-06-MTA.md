title: Optimizing Outreach with NYC MTA Data
---

### Prompt:
```
---
A potential client, WomenTechWomenYes(WTWY), has an annual gala at 
the beginning of the summer and wants to utilize the power of data 
and analytics to optimize the effectiveness of their street team 
work. The client is seeking to fill the event space with people 
passionate about increasing the participation of women in 
technology, and to concurrently build awareness and reach. To this 
end, they want to strategically place teams at subway station 
entrances to collect email addresses and those who sign up are sent 
free tickets to the gala. 

Utilize the publically available MTA subway data to optimize the 
placement of the street teams.

# Data <a name="data"></a>
* <a href="http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html" target="_blank">NYC MTA Turnstile Data</a><br/>
	* *The sample data is from May 2019 to June 2019, several weeks before the gala takes place at the end of June.*<br/>
	* *The scenario also assumes that COVID-19 did not occur in 2020.*

* <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/kingscountybrooklynboroughnewyork,queenscountyqueensboroughnewyork,richmondcountystatenislandboroughnewyork,newyorkcountymanhattanboroughnewyork,bronxcountybronxboroughnewyork,newyorkcitynewyork/PST045219" target="_blank">NYC Census Data</a><br/>

# Identifying the Best NYC Regions <a name="identifying"></a>

* The ideal participant will be one that supports the cause, shows up to the gala, and also makes a donation. Using US Census data for NYC, our team located the regions that would have this participant profile.

## A. Target Population <a name="target"></a>

1. **Percentage of women was generally even across boroughs**
<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/Percentageofwomen.png">


2. **High number of women-owned firms in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens**
<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/Women_Owned_Firms.png">


3. **High median income in Manhattan, Staten Island, Queens**
<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/Median_Income.png">

* Relaying back to the goals below for this gala, the team decided to focus on **Manhattan** and **Brooklyn**.
	1. Maximizing donations
	2. Driving awareness

	*As a note, Queens was also initially considered. However, Queens' traffic was significantly lower than Manhattan's and Brooklyn's, which did not meet the first goal of increasing attendance at the gala.*

## B. Optimal Locations and Time <a name="optimal"></a>

* Focusing on the final goal (increase attendance at the gala), our team searched for the stations with the highest foot traffic.

### Manhattan <a name="manhattan"></a>
	
1. **Top 5 stations in Manhattan by total traffic**
<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/Manhattan_Volume.png">

2. **Weekdays have significantly more traffic than weekends**
<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/Manhattan_Weekly.png">

3. **8AM - 12PM and 4PM - 8PM time periods have the most traffic**
<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/Manhattan_Hourly.png">

### Brooklyn <a name="brooklyn"></a>

1. **Top 5 stations in Brooklyn by total traffic**
<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/Brooklyn_Volume.png">

2. **Weekdays have significantly more traffic than weekends**
<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/Brooklyn_Weekly.png">

3. **8AM - 12PM and 4PM - 8PM time periods have the most traffic**
<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/Brooklyn_Hourly.png">

# Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

## A. Divide and Conquer <a name="divide"></a>

* Sending **two teams**, one to Manhattan and one to Brooklyn, will optimize the potential outreach based on foot traffic at subway stations across NYC.
	`Manhattan Top 5:
	1. 34 ST Penn Station
	2. 34 ST Herald Square
	3. 23 ST
	4. 42 ST Port Authority
	5. 42 ST Times Square`

	`Brooklyn Top 5:
	1. 59 ST
	2. ATL AV / Barclay
	3. Jay ST / Metrotec
	4. Church AV
	5. Borough Hall`

## B. Timing is Everything <a name="timing"></a>

* Weekdays see significantly more traffic than weekends - specifically **Tuesday through Friday**.

* During the day, stations are the busiest when people are commuting to and from work - specifically **8AM - 12PM** and **4PM - 8PM**.

-----

# Future Considerations <a name="future"></a>

* How effective will outreach actually be in tourist-heavy locations such as Times Square?
* Given that it is a gala for women in technology, consider where the top tech companies are located in NYC.
* Collect additional data on the likelihood of both women and men attending and donating at this type of gala.
