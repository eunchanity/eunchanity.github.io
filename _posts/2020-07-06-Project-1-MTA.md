A potential client, WomenTechWomenYes(WTWY), has an annual gala at 
the beginning of the summer and wants to utilize the power of data 
and analytics to optimize the effectiveness of their street team 
work. The client is seeking to fill the event space with people 
passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology,
and to concurrently build awareness and reach. To this end, 
they want to strategically place teams at subway station entrances
to collect email addresses and those who sign up are sent free
tickets to the gala. 

Utilize the publically available MTA subway data to optimize the 
placement of the street teams.
