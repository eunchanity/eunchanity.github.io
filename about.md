### Welcome to my data science blog!

I consider myself just an 'Average Joe' that is really fascinated with data and its applications. I aim to ask the right questions before any solution and love to craft stories out of the raw numbers.  

This blog will mainly contain my projects for the Metis Datascience bootcamp but I will also occassionally include my thoughts about the experience.
