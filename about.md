### Welcome to my data science blog!

I consider myself just an 'Average Joe' that is really fascinated with data and its applications. I aim to ask the *right questions* before any solution and love to *craft stories* out of the raw numbers.  

This blog will mainly contain my projects for the Metis Datascience bootcamp but I will also occassionally include my thoughts about the experience.
