### Welcome to My Data Science Blog!

I consider myself just an 'Average Joe' that is really fascinated with data and its applications. I aim to ask the **right questions** before any solution and love to **craft stories** out of the raw numbers.  

This blog will mainly contain my projects for the Metis Data Science Bootcamp but I will also occasionally include my thoughts about the experience.
