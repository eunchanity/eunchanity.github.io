# David Weon's Data Science Blog

Welcome! This is my GitHub repo that stores the code for my data science blog. The majority of the posts are about the projects that I completed during my time at Metis. However, I will occasionally post about some other topics such as jekyll themes, data science questions, and life updates.

Feel free to check out the blog [here](http://eunchanity.github.io/)!

I used the flexible-jekyll theme for my blog and the repo can be found [here](https://github.com/artemsheludko/flexible-jekyll).
