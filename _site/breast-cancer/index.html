              </h1>

              <p>
                During the course of my bioethics master’s program, one of the
                biggest points of discussion was the ethical spending of
                healthcare funds. What is the best way to divide up the money?
                Which population, if any, should be prioritized?
              </p>

              <p>
                One thing that most people agreed on was that given limited
                resources, the money should be spent in the most effective and
                efficient way as possible. This meant that the investment should
                go to the medical procedures and technologies that provided the
                most return on investment - not only in terms of money but also
                in terms of patient lives.
              </p>

              <p>
                So it was frustrating to learn that
                <b>false-positive mammograms</b> and over diagnosis of breast
                cancer cost <b>$4 billion in healthcare spending annually</b>.
                For those that are unaware, a mammogram is an x-ray picture of
                the breast and it is actually suggested that women get annual
                screenings beginning at the age of 40.
              </p>

              <p>
                I want to focus on the term false-positive here - this means
                that the mammogram is determined to be abnormal even though
                there’s no cancer. This is happening between
                <b>22-31% of all diagnoses</b> - a staggering rate. So I wanted
                to see if a classification model could be used as a more
                effective and efficient way of determining benign or malignant
                breast cancer.
              </p>

                I utilized the work of Dr. William Wolberg, whose breast cancer
                study and dataset were available in the UCI Machine Learning
                repository. This dataset was used to obtain the scores (1-10)
                for each tumor characteristic.
              </p>

              <p>The tumor characteristics were defined as follows:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Clump thickness</b>: assesses if cells are mono- or

                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Uniformity of cell size</b>: evaluates the consistency in
                  size of cells in sample

                  <b>Marginal adhesion</b>: quantifies how much cells on the
                  outside of the epithelial tend to stick together
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Single epithelial cell size</b>: relates to cell
                  uniformity, determines if epithelial cells are significantly
                  enlarged
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Bare nuclei</b>: calculates the proportion of the number of
                  cells not surrounded by cytoplasm to those that are
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Bland chromatin</b>: rates the uniform “texture” of the

                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Normal nucleoli</b>: determines whether the nucleoli are
                  small and barely visible or larger, more visible, and more

                An initial baseline model was created to get a sense of how well
                the features (tumor characteristics) predicted a
                benign/malignant tumor. Then, the data was run through multiple
                classification models including k-nearest neighbors, logistic
                regression, decision tree, random forest, gaussian naive bayes,
                and support vector machine.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the end, the <b>logistic regression model</b> was selected
                not only for its high scores, but also for its interpretability.
              </p>

                I decided to focus on the F1 score for discussion. Typically,
                for medical cases, the focus is on the precision score, which
                focuses on the true positives out of the total positive cases.
                This means that people want to focus more on correctly
                diagnosing malignant breast cancer to the patients that actually
                have malignant breast cancer. This I completely agree with - as
                many as <b>90,000 women are misdiagnosed per year</b>, which
                causes significant physical, financial, and psychological harm
                to patients. However, I’d argue that false negatives are just as
                damaging to patients, if not more, than false positives. The
                patient is being told that they don’t have malignant breast
                cancer but in reality, they do. Thus, I selected the F1 score in
                order to take into account both important aspects of the
                diagnosis.
              </p>

              <p>
                You can see above that the confusion matrix is showing that my
                model did really well in predicting benign or malignant breast
                cancer. Both the false positives and false negatives are held
                really low, making the model a great way to avoid misdiagnoses.
              </p>

              <p>
                <img

              </p>

              <p>
                The model coefficients show the relative effect of the
                characteristics on the probability of a tumor being malignant.
                The graph shows that cell degradation (represented by bare
                nuclei) and tumor growth (represented by clump thickness) have
                the greatest effect on malignant probability. This makes sense
                as cancers in general are defined by their abnormal growth due
                to some type of mutation in the cell’s function.

              <p>
                Diagnosing benign or malignant breast cancer can be
                significantly improved by using machine learning algorithms
                along with human interpretation. I’m not saying we should
                completely replace human doctors, but these classification
                models can provide supporting evidence. At the end of the day,
                we can all agree that the goal is to improve patient lives.

              <p>
                Also, with the saved costs in decreasing misdiagnoses, the money
                can be used in other areas of healthcare that may need it more.
                $4 billion is a relatively small percentage of the entire US
                healthcare spending, but its use can still have significant
                impact. It’s better served in areas such as research rather than
                misdiagnoses.

                  Creating and testing image recognition models on the
                  mammograms themselves. This presentation compared mammograms
                  to tumor samples, which is not exactly an apples to apples
                  comparison.

                  Understand teh cost differences between getting a mammogram
                  and a tumor sampling - including things such as coverage by
                  insurance, result timing, etc.
