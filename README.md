# David Weon's Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This is my GitHub repo that stores the code for my portfolio of data science projects. My posts will walk you through the project starting from project conception, data collection, data modeling, data analysis, and key conclusions.

Feel free to check out the blog [here](http://eunchanity.github.io/)!

I used the flexible-jekyll theme for my blog and the repo can be found [here](https://github.com/artemsheludko/flexible-jekyll).
